### Practice Test

```bash
python3 scripts/practice-test.py
```

Generates a random 35-question exam from the real pool, scores it, and shows which areas need work.

### Audio Study Guide 🎧

Every section and the cram sheet are available as MP3 audio — study while driving, working out, or doing chores.

| File | Duration |
|------|----------|
| `subelements/T1-fcc-rules.mp3` | 52 min |
| `subelements/T2-operating-procedures.mp3` | 24 min |
| `subelements/T3-radio-waves.mp3` | 24 min |
| `subelements/T4-amateur-practices.mp3` | 17 min |
| `subelements/T5-electrical-principles.mp3` | 29 min |
| `subelements/T6-components.mp3` | 26 min |
| `subelements/T7-practical-circuits.mp3` | 29 min |
| `subelements/T8-signals-emissions.mp3` | 33 min |
| `subelements/T9-antennas-feedlines.mp3` | 17 min |
| `subelements/T0-safety.mp3` | 27 min |
| `CRAM-SHEET.mp3` | 9 min |
| **Total** | **4h 47m** |

Each MP3 reads the full question, all answer choices, the correct answer, and the explanation. Pronunciation of ham radio acronyms follows standard conventions (see `tts/pronunciation.md`).

### Cram Sheet

[CRAM-SHEET.md](CRAM-SHEET.md) — one page of key facts, formulas, frequencies, and power limits. Read this the morning of your exam.

## Regenerating Audio

Audio is generated via [Kokoro](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI) (OpenAI-compatible TTS). Requires Python 3.6+, `curl`, `ffmpeg`.

```bash
export SPEECH_URL="https://your-server:8100/v1/audio/speech"
python3 tts/generate-audio.py --all --voice af_heart
```

Pronunciation rules are in `tts/pronunciation.md`. Use `--dry-run` to preview spoken text.

## Updating for a New Pool

1. Download the new pool PDF from [ncvec.org](https://ncvec.org/index.php/amateur-question-pools)
2. Parse into `pools/YYYY-YYYY/questions.json`
3. Regenerate subelement files and update practice test pool path
4. Update dates in this README
5. Regenerate audio with the TTS pipeline above

## Question Pool Source
